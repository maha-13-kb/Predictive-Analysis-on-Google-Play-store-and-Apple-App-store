# Predictive-Analysis-on-Google-Play-store-and-Apple-App-store
### ABSTRACT
In this study, we have analysed the two prominent app stores - Google Play Store and iOS App Store. The main aim of our project is to analyse the data on apps in both app/play stores and provide meaningful insights. We have tried to predict the genre of app to the accuracy of App Store apps. To cluster the Play Store apps based on user reviews. Next, we have done Exploratory Data Analysis on Price Distribution for both. Further, we have predicted the price of free apps (App/Play stores) using the  Regression Model. The final result of this predictive analysis would tell us about how factors that we took into consideration have significant influence on the apps.
